# responsive-example

This is a demo of how to do basic responsive styles by css.
The layout flows according to screen sizes (left to right on desktop -> top to bottom on mobile).

The first example uses `float` property, the second and the third use `display: flex;`.
While the third example shows that, with `display: flex;`, we can change the rendering order of elements (i.e. can be different from the actual order of DOM).
